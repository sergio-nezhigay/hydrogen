Review data will be fetched from Judge.me CDN\nTo see support for Hydrogen V1, please visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/@judgeme/shopify-hydrogen\n\n# Known issues\n- Widgets will flash (disappear and reappear swiftly) because of the way Hydrogen2 renders components. We will release a react version for the widgets in the future.\n- Widgets may appear twice (depends on your `delay` config)\n\n# Getting Started\n\n**Installation:**\n- Install module: `npm i @judgeme/shopify-hydrogen-2`\n- Edit content and rename `.env.development.example` to `.env`:\n```\nJUDGEME_SHOP_DOMAIN=\"your shop domain registered with Judge.me\"\nJUDGEME_PUBLIC_TOKEN=\"judge.me public token\"\nJUDGEME_CDN_HOST=\"https://cdn.judge.me\"\n```\n\n# Usage guide: \n- Code below is taken from the Hydrogen V2 sample storefront.\n### A. Setup:\n- In your `root.jsx` file, `loader` function, add Judge.me configuration in the defer return\nE.g:\n```jsx\n  return defer({\n    // ... other properties\n    judgeme: {\n      shopDomain: context.env.JUDGEME_SHOP_DOMAIN,\n      publicToken: context.env.JUDGEME_PUBLIC_TOKEN,\n      cdnHost: context.env.JUDGEME_CDN_HOST,\n      delay: 500, // optional parameter, default to 500ms\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n- In function `App()`, import and register judgeme module with credentials above\n```jsx\nimport {useJudgeme} from '@kyakaze/shopify-hydrogen-2'\n//...\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const data = useLoaderData();\n  useJudgeme(data.judgeme);\n  // ... rest of your script\n}\n```\n\n### B. Widgets:\n\nBelow is the list of our widget components:\n\n```js\nimport {\n  JudgemeMedals,\n  JudgemeCarousel,\n  JudgemeReviewsTab,\n  JudgemePreviewBadge,\n  JudgemeReviewWidget,\n  JudgemeVerifiedBadge,\n  JudgemeAllReviewsCount,\n  JudgemeAllReviewsRating,\n} from \"@judgeme/shopify-hydrogen-2\";\n ```\n\n#### **These following widgets require param `id`**\n- Components: `JudgemeReviewWidget`, `JudgemePreviewBadge` and `JudgemeVerifiedBadge`\n- Required props: `product id`, it could be either shopify graph ID or simply ID: `gid://shopify/Product/12345678`, `12345678`.\n- example:\n    ```jsx\n    <JudgemeVerifiedBadge id={product.id}/>\n    ```\n#### **Other widgets**\n```jsx\n  <JudgemeAllReviewsCount />\n```\n-----------\n\n# References\nHydrogen is a React framework and SDK that you can use to build fast and dynamic Shopify custom storefronts.\n\n[Check out the docs](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen)\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","description":"This module helps integrate Judge.me Widgets to Hydrogen V2 storefront app. Currently, it works mostly on the client side.
